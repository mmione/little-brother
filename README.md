## A non-intrusive, not scary, open source, and simple home-monitoring solution. 

Turn an old phone ðŸ“± into something useful again using Python and OpenCV. 

## What do I need? 

* Old phone (Android or IOS based)
* DroidCam or any other IP camera software
* a LAN (you don't even need internet access, just the router)
* a Gmail account from which you want to send emails 
## Installation
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Configuration

Specific things such as the email to send info to, etc. should be specified in the root of the cloned repository,
in a YAML file named __config.yml__. An example is shown below:

```yaml
email: example@gmail.com   # email that you want information sent to by the application
ip: 192.168.0.122:4747      # IP of the droidcam/ip cam instance
framerate: 5                # Framerate of the exported video
```
Next, make sure you configure your gmail account from which you want to **send** emails by toggling the following setting to *on* as seen in the attached image:
